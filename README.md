# SQL_EmployeeDatabase

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

The purpose of this project is to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

## Task

- [Data Engineering](https://github.com/ovinueza/SQL_Employee_Database/blob/master/QuickDBD-EmployeeDatabase.sql)
Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remembering to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

- [Data Analysis SQL](https://github.com/ovinueza/SQL_Employee_Database/blob/master/EmployeeDatabaseQueries.sql)
Once the database is created run some queries

- [Further Data Analysis with Pandas](https://github.com/ovinueza/SQL_Employee_Database/blob/master/EmployeeDatabase_Analysis.ipynb)
Use SQLAlchemy adn Python-Pandas for further analysis and visualization of the data.
